# smethwick colours

![this is what they look like](./colours.png)

a low-ish saturation colour palette for uis and other things too i'm sure.

please note i made these using a monitor with very poor colour reproduction but
they should still look okay on a good monitor.

these are CC0. i don't think you can actually copyright a set of colours anyway.
